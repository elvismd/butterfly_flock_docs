This is a very initial version but it's very simple to setup:
### Flock Settings
Configure things such as amount of butterflies, minimum distance to change position, spawn bounds and other basic numbers.

### Resting
These are resting spots where the butterflies can take a rest after flying around for a while. Rest Delay is for an interval before the butterfly chooses a spot and Rest Time is how much they stay at the point. They are vector2 variables because the number is randomized each time between the X and Y of these variables.

### Avoidance
Here you configure the avoidance behaviour. It starts with good settings. You can change the length of the raycast and which objects within which layers the butterflies are going to check against. The avoidance force is applied to their flying direction so they change course intead of flying right into the colliders.
